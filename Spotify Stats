-- In this project, I performed analytics on a Spotify database using SQL

--what is the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track? 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(danceability), AVG(energy)
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC, artist_name ASC
LIMIT 10;

--what artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name
FROM spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms = 
(SELECT MAX(duration_ms) FROM spotifydata);
