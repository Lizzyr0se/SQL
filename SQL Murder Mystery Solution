--The SQL Murder Mystery
--https://mystery.knightlab.com/

--Info we know:
--crime = murder
--date = Jan 15, 2018
--location = SQL City

--First, pull crime report

SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE type = 'murder'
AND date = 20180115
AND city = 'SQL City';

--We found out the crime description!
–“Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. 
--The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". 
--The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".”

--Now, we need to find out the id numbers for both witnesses:

SELECT id, MAX(address_number)
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr';

--Witness 1 has id 14887

SELECT id
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'
AND name LIKE '%Annabel%';

--Witness 2 has id 16371

--Let’s read their witness reports

SELECT *
FROM interview
WHERE person_id = 14887;

--Witness 1 said: “I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. 
--The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". 
--Only gold members have those bags. 
--The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W"."

SELECT *
FROM interview
WHERE person_id = 16371;

--Witness 2 said: “I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.”

--Let’s find all the people that have a gold status gym membership number that start with '48Z'

SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_member
WHERE id LIKE '48Z%'
AND membership_status = 'gold';

--Two men matched our query: 
--Joe Germuska – membership id – 48Z7A / person id - 28819 
--Jeremy Bowers – membership id – 48Z55 / person id - 67318

--When was Witness 2 at the gym?

SELECT * 
FROM get_fit_now_member
WHERE person_id = 16371;

--We found out her membership id – 90081

SELECT * 
FROM get_fit_now_check_in
WHERE membership_id = '90081'
AND check_in_date = 20180109;

--We can see she saw the murderer at the gym between 1600 and 1700

--When were our two suspects at the gym?

SELECT * 
FROM get_fit_now_check_in
WHERE membership_id IN ('48Z7A','48Z55')
AND check_in_date = 20180109;

--Joe was there from 1600 to 1730
--Jeremy was there from 1530 to 1700

--Dang it, it could still be both of them!

--Let’s find out who drives the car with a partial plate of 'H42W'

SELECT *
FROM drivers_license
WHERE plate_number LIKE '%H42W%';

--Three different drivers license numbers match the partial plate: 183779, 423327, and 664760

--Who belongs to these drivers license numbers?

SELECT id, name, license_id
FROM person
WHERE license_id IN (183779, 423327, 664760);

--We got a hit!! Jeremy Bowers has license id 423327! We found the murderer!

INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
        
SELECT value FROM solution;

--Congrats, you found the murderer! 
--But wait, there's more... 
--If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. 
--If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. 

SELECT *
FROM interview
WHERE person_id = 67318;

--The murderer said “I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. 
--I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). 
--She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. 
--I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.”

--Query 1
--Find drivers license number

SELECT *
FROM drivers_license
WHERE gender = 'female'
AND height BETWEEN 65 AND 67
AND hair_color = 'red'
AND car_make = 'Tesla'
AND car_model = 'Model S';

--Three drivers license numbers came back: 202298, 291182, and 918773

--Query 2
--Find all the people who went to the symphony three times in December 2017

SELECT person_id, COUNT(event_id)
FROM facebook_event_checkin
WHERE event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
AND date LIKE '201712%'
GROUP BY person_id
HAVING COUNT(event_id) = 3;

--Two id numbers came back: 24556 and 99716

--Let’s see if our id numbers match any of our drivers license numbers

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE license_id IN (202298, 291182, 918773);

--We got a match!! Miranda Priestly has id 99716! We found the true criminal!!

INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Miranda Priestly');
        
SELECT value FROM solution;

--Congrats, you found the brains behind the murder! 
--Everyone in SQL City hails you as the greatest SQL detective of all time. 
--Time to break out the champagne!
