--Oh dear, what happened? It seems that I am the only survivor of the air crash. Wow, there are some villages on this island.

SELECT *
FROM village;

--It seems there are a few people living in these villages. How can I see a list of all inhabitants?


SELECT *
FROM inhabitant;

--Man! I'm hungry. I will go and find a butcher to ask for some free sausages.

SELECT * 
FROM inhabitant 
WHERE job = 'butcher';

--There you are! Enjoy your meal! But take care of yourself. As long as you are unarmed, stay away from villains. Not everyone on this island is friendly.

--Thank you, Edward! Okay, let's see who is friendly on this island...

SELECT *
FROM inhabitant
WHERE state = 'friendly';

--There is no way around getting a sword for myself. I will now try to find a friendly weaponsmith to forge me one.

SELECT *
FROM inhabitant
WHERE state = 'friendly'
AND job = 'weaponsmith';

--Oh, that does not look good. Maybe other friendly smiths can help you out.

SELECT *
FROM inhabitant
WHERE state = 'friendly'
AND job LIKE '%smith';

--That looks better! I will go and visit those smiths.

--Hi stranger! Where are you going? I'm Paul, I'm the major of Monkeycity. I will go ahead and register you as a citizen.

INSERT INTO inhabitant (name, villageid, gender, job, gold, state) 
VALUES ('Stranger', 1, '?', '?', 0, '?');

--No need to call me stranger! What's my personid?

SELECT personid
FROM inhabitant
WHERE name = 'Stranger';

--personid is 20!

--Hi Ernest! How much is a sword?

--I can offer to make you a sword for 150 gold. That's the cheapest you will find! How much gold do you have?

SELECT gold
FROM inhabitant
WHERE name = 'Stranger';

--Stranger has no gold

--Damn! No mon, no fun. There has to be another option to earn gold other than going to work. 
--Maybe I could collect ownerless items and sell them! 
--Can I make a list of all items that don't belong to anyone?

SELECT *
FROM item
WHERE owner IS NULL;

--So much cool stuff!
– Yay, a coffee cup. Let's collect it!

UPDATE item 
SET owner = 20 
WHERE item = 'coffee cup';

--Do you know a trick how to collect all the ownerless items?

UPDATE item
SET owner = 20
WHERE owner IS NULL;

--Now list all of the items I have!
SELECT *
FROM item
WHERE owner = 20;

--Find a friendly inhabitant who is either a dealer or a merchant. Maybe they want to buy some of my items.

SELECT *
FROM inhabitant
WHERE state = 'friendly'
AND (job = 'merchant' OR job = 'dealer');

--I'd like to get the ring and the teapot. The rest is nothing but scrap. Please give me the two items. My personid is 15.

UPDATE item
SET owner = 15
WHERE item IN ('ring','teapot');

–Thank you!
--Here, some gold

UPDATE inhabitant 
SET gold = gold + 120 
WHERE personid = 20 

--Unfortunately, that's not enough gold to buy a sword. Seems like I do have to work after all. 
--Maybe it's not a bad idea to change my name from Stranger to my real name before I will apply for a job.

UPDATE inhabitant
SET name = 'Sam'
WHERE personid = 20;

--Since baking is one of my hobbies, why not find a baker who I can work for?

SELECT *
FROM inhabitant
WHERE job = 'baker'
ORDER BY gold DESC;

--Aha, Paul! I know him!

--Hi, you again! So, Sam is your name. I saw you want to work as a baker? Okay! You will be paid 1 gold for 100 bread rolls.
--(8 hours later...) Here, I made ten thousand bread rolls! I quit! This should be enough money to buy a sword. Let's see what happens with my gold balance.

UPDATE inhabitant 
SET gold = gold + 100 - 150 
WHERE personid = 20;

--Here's your new sword, Som! Now you can go everywhere.

INSERT INTO item (item, owner) 
VALUES ('sword', 20);

--My name is Sam! Thanks anyway!
--Is there a pilot on this island by any chance? He could fly me home.

SELECT *
FROM inhabitant
WHERE job = 'pilot';

--Oh no, his state is 'kidnapped'.
--Horrible, the pilot is held captive by Dirty Dieter!

SELECT village.name 
FROM village, inhabitant 
WHERE village.villageid = inhabitant.villageid 
AND inhabitant.name = 'Dirty Dieter';

--Dirty Dieter is in Onionville!
--I can find out the chief's name of the village Onionville.

SELECT i.name
FROM inhabitant AS i
JOIN village AS v
ON i.villageid=v.villageid
AND v.chief=i.personid
WHERE v.name = 'Onionville';

--I've got it! I will visit Fred and ask him about Dirty Dieter and the pilot.
--Um, how many inhabitants does Onionville have?

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM inhabitant, village 
WHERE village.villageid = inhabitant.villageid 
AND village.name = 'Onionville';

--There are 8 inhabitants

--Hello Sam, the pilot is held captive by Dirty Dieter in his sister's house. 
--Shall I tell you how many women there are in Onionville? Nah, you can figure it out by yourself!

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM inhabitant
WHERE gender = 'f'
AND villageid =

--Oh, only one woman. What's her name?

SELECT name
FROM inhabitant

AND villageid = 
(SELECT villageid 
FROM village
WHERE name = 'Onionville');

--Her name is Dirty Diane
--Let’s go

--Sam, if you hand me over the entire property of our nearby village Cucumbertown, I will release the pilot. I will show you now what this property consists of.

SELECT SUM(inhabitant.gold) 
FROM inhabitant, village 
WHERE village.villageid = inhabitant.villageid 
AND village.name = 'Cucumbertown';

--8980 gold!
--Oh no, baking bread alone can't solve my problems. 
--If I continue working and selling items though, I could earn more gold than the worth of gold inventories of all bakers, dealers and merchants together. 
--How much gold is that?

SELECT SUM(gold)
FROM inhabitant
WHERE job IN ('baker','dealer','merchant');

--4130 gold!
--That’s not enough

--Let's have a look at how much average gold people own, depending on their job.

SELECT job, SUM(inhabitant.gold), AVG(inhabitant.gold) 
FROM inhabitant 
GROUP BY job 
ORDER BY AVG(inhabitant.gold);

--Very interesting: For some reason, butchers own the most gold. How much gold do different inhabitants have on average, depending on their state?

SELECT state, AVG(gold)
FROM inhabitant
GROUP BY state;

--Ok, so the only way is to mug the villains.
--Or I might as well go ahead and just kill Dirty Dieter with my sword!

DELETE FROM inhabitant 
WHERE name = 'Dirty Dieter';

--Heeeey! Now I'm very angry! What will you do next, Sam?

DELETE FROM inhabitant
WHERE name = 'Dirty Diane';

--Yeah! Now I release the pilot!

UPDATE inhabitant
SET state = 'friendly'
WHERE job = 'pilot';

--Thank's for releasing me, Sam! I will fly you home!
--I take my sword, some gold and lots of useless items with me as a souvenir. What a big adventure!

UPDATE inhabitant 
SET state = 'emigrated' 
WHERE personid = 20;
